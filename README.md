### Description
React Native Assessment - Game of Thrones Allstars

We provided some simple React native template code. Your goal is to leverage the following API (https://anapioficeandfire.com/) to retrieve the first 25 (or more) characters with non-empty names and display them in a list. The user should then be able to select up to a maximum of 10 of their favorite GoT Allstars. Each list item should at a minimum display the character's full name and indicate whether the item is selected. Any additional styling or functionality is up to you.
